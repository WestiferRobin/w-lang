- variables_{0}_test.w: string, num, char, and array 
    - assign in the correct format
        - both const and let in both scope and global
- {0}_test.w: arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise (include delete opp with bitwise)
    - do all operators for arrays, strings, nums, and chars
        - both const and let in both scope and global
- condtionals_test.w
    - do just an if statements
    - do an if statement with else statement
    - do elif statement
    - do a nested if statement
    - do a elif statements with nested statement
- loops_test.w 
    - do a for loop
    - do a while loop 
    - do a nested for loop 
    - do a nested while loop
    - nested for while loop and visa versa
- aux_test.w 
    - just use the "System Aux Functions" example with a bit more print statements
        - see if you can include SCAN but not required
- functions_{0}_test.w: array, string, num, and char 
    - use local and global variables both const and let
    - do recursion
    - do one with a loop, basic elif conditional, and use aux functions
        - aux: RANDOM and for string/array: APPEND, REMOVE, LENGTH, and EQUAL
- import_test.w
    - create three files math.w, constants.w and random.w
        - these will be wrappers to do an operations of an array. Were just testing the imports and exports.
