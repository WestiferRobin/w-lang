W_Lang - Outline 

- Abstract
    - The W language is a C mimic language.
    - It is a gernal purpose language, procedual language, and supports weak types.
    - Influenced by Java's philosophy of compiling byte code and then interperted. 
- How to build W_lang compiler
    - macos/linux
    - windows
- How to Code in W_Lang
    - The standard libraries have Print, Scan, Copy, Equal, and Length.
    - Show standard constants.
    - Show examples of standard libraries and constants.
    - Show global variables, local variables, arrays, and strings.
    - Example of a hello world with said example.
    - All about Loops with examples
    - All about Control Flow with examples
    - All about Functions with examples
    - Demos to implement all of W_Lang
        - Insertion and Selection Sort
        - Quicksort
        - Hangman
        - Text Game
- Reason W_Lang was created
    - A challenge to make a compiler and language. 
    - Show my C++ skills
    - Use for as a learning tool on how to program
- Challenges 
    - Creating a pracical compiler is hard
    - Implementing and deciding LL(1) and LR(1) processing
    - Creating test cases for syntax
        - arrays and strings are nightmares 
        - forced to implement weak types and create byte code instead of machine assembly
    - Deciding what features should be included on the fly based on limitations
- Broken Stuff with Explination
    - passing Raw string as param is broken. Unsure why it keeps failing.
- Future Features
    - I will take a long break or leave It
    - Include a file reading system
    - Would like to implement OOP
    - include pointers
    - able to include optimizations and modes
        - simular to compiler optimizations like -O3
        - like Golang to be an interperter and compiler
            - interperter like python
            - byte code like Java
            - run machine code like C
    - include tools for development
        - frameworks
        - An IDE specific and/or IntelliSense" like tools for VSCode, Atom, and etc
        - create loadable like modules like pip or npm
